Warning! Proceed with Caution 

By installing Nocturne, you're about to embark on a thrilling adventure 
where your system may undergo some serious changes. Here's what you’re 
signing up for:

New Software: You’ll be welcoming a whole new set of applications to your 
system. Think of it as a software party where everyone’s invited. Don’t worry, 
we’ve vetted the guests... mostly.

Defaults Changes: Your default settings are getting a makeover. Think of it 
as a personal stylist giving your desktop a fresh new look and feel. We promise 
it’s not a mullet.

Possible Side Effects: In rare and dramatic cases, this installation may break 
your system. It’s like a box of chocolates—you never really know what you're 
gonna get. But hey, if things go sideways, we recommend a solid backup and a 
sense of humor. It’s only a system, not a life.

Best Experience: For optimal results, make sure you're logged into a GNOME 
session before starting the installation. Trust us, it’ll make everything 
smoother and less like trying to assemble IKEA furniture in the dark.
